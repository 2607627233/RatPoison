## Beginner's guide video <a name = "video"></a>

[![video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/LXBTAnnwahU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXBTAnnwahU)

Recommended to watch before continuing.

## Compilation <a name = "compilation"></a>
The first step is to compile the source code into a usable cheat program.

* Download the latest updates (which includes the newest features) by downloading directly as a ZIP.
* Extract the contents from the archive to any folder (to your desktop, for example).
* Double click on the "_installer_" (_installer.exe_) script and wait for it to complete.

Once those steps are complete, the usable cheat program can be found within the _build_
directory, and will be in a directory called **RatPoison 1.7**.

From within the **RatPoison 1.7** directory, you can start the cheat by running
the _"Start RatPoison 1.7"_ script.
If you have chosen to randomize the cheat name, you should open the file ending in .bat which should show ![BatFile](https://i.imgur.com/JZAhmtr.png) as an icon.

You can launch the cheat at any time after launching CSGO.

## Common issues <a name = "issues"></a>
* Overlay is black/doesn't go transparent/isn't showing up
    * The overlay only works on Windows 10, it doesn't turn transparent on W7
    * CSGO needs to be borderless/windowed for the overlay to show up on top of CS, otherwise it's just an app in your taskbar
    * JDK 1.8 is also known to cause this problem, make sure you have JDK 12 or later installed

* Game looks framey despite having normal FPS (example 144hz/144fps, but looks like 60)
    * Lowering opengl fps to 30 helps
    * Enabling gsync & disabling vsync if supported
   
* Cheat is stuck at launching? Make sure you have checked all of those steps:
    * you are running currently most up-to-date version of RatPoison
    * you disabled all anti-cheat clients working on your computer
    * your RatPoison folder is placed somewhere with all running permissions
    * you don't use RatPoison with some other cheats running
    * you aren't currently running VAC bypass (running the bat file with administrator privileges should work)
    * you restarted your computer

    If nothing else works then you can try running the bat file as admin.

## Grenade helper <a name = "grenade-helper"></a>
Overlay Only
Configurable in the Nade Helper Tab. Files hold all positions from when saved in the menu. The template file included is Mirage.txt, load
into a test/offline Mirage map, make sure it's selected in the drop down and then click the 'Load From File' button. Then press the key corresponding to the
'Nade Helper Toggle Key' (Default F2) to toggle visibility of the positions around the map. They are only visible when within a certain distance, to make sure you can see them
the main spots are T spawn, A ramp, and top mid, if you don't see any in these areas press the toggle key a few times to see if they do pop up, if the file is loaded
(testable in the cmd, should say 'Loading Positions'), and walk around a bit to see if you were not in range before. The 'Clear Currently Loaded' button clears all positions currently loaded. The 'Create Grenade Position'
button saves your current position, and where you are looking, and asks you to enter a name for the position (ex. 'Smoke Mid'), so go to a position, test the throw and if it's how how you want
it go back to that spot, aim appropriately and save the position (or save before and delete the position if you have to). The 'Delete At Current Position' button deletes a position if you are standing on top of it, and
is highlighted blue. The starting head position isn't completely centered on your screen, to line yourself up with the position, look straight down and center your cursor with the
middle of the circle, then look up and aim at the circle in the air.

If you have older versions of saved txt files from before Hotfix 6 these will cause an error when loaded using RP.
To fix you need to edit the text file and add the nade type (Flash, Smoke, Molly, Frag) after the position name, see the example Mirage.txt file for an example, case sensitive and must be spelled correctly
